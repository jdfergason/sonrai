# Sonrai

Sonrai provides tools to manage the process of importing and monitoring data. It provides a scheduling server that can restart failed commands

## Getting Started

The sonrai server is built using mage. Build the server with the command `mage build` and run it with the command `sonrai serve`. This will start
the api service and provide access to the Web UI. Additional documentation is available in the `doc` directory.
